# Handout

Go to <https://github.com/matthew-brett/bham-turing>

Look for `bham_turing_th1_handout.pdf` in the `townhall-1` directory.

* Analysis of functional brain images, since 1996;
* Heavy user of, contributor to scientific Python stack since 2006;
* At UC Berkeley for 10 years or so, returning in 2017.

Donoho calls this "Lesser data science".

# The data scientist in industry

> ... what data scientists do is make discoveries while swimming in data ...
> At ease in the digital realm, they are able to bring structure to large
> quantities of formless data and make analysis possible. ... Data scientists’
> most basic, universal skill is the ability to write code.

[@davenport2012data] - "Who Are These People?"

# Who are these people?

> Some of the best and brightest data scientists are PhDs in esoteric fields
> like ecology and systems biology. George Roumeliotis, the head of a data
> science team at Intuit in Silicon Valley, holds a doctorate in astrophysics.

# What does this describe?

> Data science is an approach to data analysis with a foundation in code
> and algorithms.

# Teaching at Berkeley

* Massive (~1500 student) course [Foundations of data
  science](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-8).  No
  requirements in mathematics or programming.  Running since 2015.
* Large (~900 student) intermediate course [Principles and techniques of data
  science](http://www.ds100.org) with further requirements in Python programming and linear algebra.
* [27 Connector courses](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/connectors) using
  teaching methods from the foundation course.
* The greatest change in undergraduate teaching in a generation.

# What does this look like for research?

*   Careers
*   Education and Training
*   Tools and Software
*   Reproducibility and Open Science
*   Physical and Intellectual Space
*   Data Science Studies

Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments: Themes. <http://msdse.org/themes>. (\$37.8M).

# Recruiting for data science research

* Berkeley [Division of data science](https://data.berkeley.edu).
* New recruitment half-time division of data science, half in their home
  department (of astronomy, psychology etc).

# What should we do?

We should:

* reflect on the nature of the change that "data science" represents;
* study success and failure of other universities in their "data
  science" initiatives;
* consider our own barriers to fruitful "data science environments";
* plan for huge changes in teaching and research.

# Conclusion

* "Lesser data science" will go the way of "e-science" and other fashions.
* "Greater data science" is going to transform teaching and research.
* Business as usual means "lesser data science".
* "Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important
  intellectual event of the next fifty years"
